                <p>My name is Jeffery Hu and I am currently a grade 12 student in the MaCS program at William Lyon
                    Mackenzie CI.

                    My passions include programming, business, engineering, math, and science. Throughout the year, I
                    take part in many competitions and hackathons where I especially enjoy building things with
                    real-world applications.
                    In my spare time, I like to listen to audiobooks and watch movies/documentaries. I also love to play
                    sports, staying up to date with current events and solving real-world problems!

                <h3><b>Passion for Coding</b></h3>
                <p>Ever since grade 6, I have been passionate about coding. I remember learning my first programming
                    language, JavaScript, through watching countless Khan Academy videos on if/else statements, loops,
                    functions, and much more. It amazes me how much you can do with a few lines of code. Since then, I
                    have remained passionate and active in computer programming. In high school, I enrolled in a
                    specialized math, science, and computer science program called MaCS. As a part of the MaCS program,
                    I was able to take extra enriched computer science courses. Outside of school, I have stayed
                    involved in computer programming by attending many competitive coding competitions, being an active
                    member of my school’s computer programming team, and working on personal projects (like this one!).
                    I am especially excited about the applications of coding, and how it can be applied in different
                    fields such as business, finance, and engineering. In the future, I plan to take part in
                    more hackathons and keep working on personal projects that I am passionate about (e.g. right now I
                    am working on an application to help my parents keep track of their stock investments and their
                    performance statistics!).

                <h3 class="mt-6 my-3" style="padding-top: 2%"><b>Love of STEM</b></h3>
                <p>In addition to computer programming, I am also very passionate about science, engineering, and
                    mathematics. I especially enjoy how these subjects can help explain everything that’s happening
                    around me, from gravity to micro-bacteria. I particularly enjoy engineering, as it takes science
                    concepts and applies them for everyday use. In addition to studying and taking enriched courses in
                    these fields, I also try to give back to the community by getting involved in school clubs. As the
                    President of Mackenzie Science Club, I help coordinate and lead weekly STEM-based events for over
                    200 members. During the spring, we also hold the Mackenzie Science and Engineering Olympics, which
                    draws over 700 middle school students from across Ontario. Overall, taking part in Mackenzie Science
                    Club has allowed me to express my passion for STEM while also giving back and getting the next
                    generation engaged!

                <p>I am also very intrigued by finance and economics. Recently, I have become very interested in using coding
                    to help track business growth. As a member and now Co-President of my school’s DECA chapter (a business club), I have
                    been able to soak up a lot of business knowledge that I want to use with my other skills to solve
                    real-world problems. Finally, in my free time, I love to get outside with friends and play sports.
                    My favourites include soccer, badminton, and ultimate frisbee. I always enjoy the teamwork and
                    collaboration involved in these activities and the friendships they help to foster!
