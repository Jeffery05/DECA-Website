            <p> DECA is an international business case competition where students compete in different events to develop
                their communication, problem-solving and analysis skills. In total, over 200,000+ students compete in
                the United States and Canada. The competition is composed of 2 core elements: a multiple choice exam and
                a case presentation. The multiple-choice exam measures competitors’ knowledge of business concepts while
                the case presentation tests their public speaking and problem-solving skills. Altogether, there are 3
                levels of competition: Regionals, Provincials, and Internationals. Regionals are held in November
                between competitors in Toronto. Those who qualify move onto Provincials, which is held at the downtown
                Sheraton in February between competitors from all across Ontario. Finally, Provincial Champions are
                invited to the DECA International Career Development Conference (ICDC), which is hosted in Orlando,
                Florida for the 2022-23 season.

            <p>School DECA clubs (or “chapters”) are responsible for registering and preparing their members for the
                DECA competition. DECA Mackenzie is the official DECA chapter for William Lyon Mackenzie CI.
                Historically, DECA Mackenzie is one of the largest and oldest clubs at WLMAC, with over 60+ exceptional
                members specially selected through a grueling application process. To train for the competition, we meet
                every Tuesday at lunch in business classrooms. Due to the expertise of our trainers, our extensive
                resource drive, and the hard-work of our members, we are known during competitions as one of the
                best-trained and highest-achieving chapters.

            <p>If you are looking to develop your public speaking skills, learn more about business, or meet new people,
                then DECA is for you. As a member, you will be welcomed into a tight-knit community where you can
                establish long-lasting relationships with other like-minded people. Through practice and competition,
                you will gain confidence in youself and your abilities. You will also develop the capacity to think
                quickly on your feet and present your ideas effectively. Finally, through studying business concepts,
                you will have a better knowledge of marketing, finance, and entrepreneurship and how they shape our
                everyday lives.

            <p>Unfortuntately, due to DECA regulations, our chapter is limited to ~60 competitors. This means that
                members are selected through a rigorous application process consisting of both a written component and
                an interview (for those selected). Before applying, be sure to research more about the 6 different
                clusters in the competition (principles, marketing, hospitality & tourism, business management and
                administration, finance, and entrepeneurship) and which one you would like to participate in.
                Applications are released around end of September in order to maximize the amount of training before
                Regionals. Be sure to regularly check the Announcements page to stay updated!
